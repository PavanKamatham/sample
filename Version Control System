1. Version Control system records changes that made to code overtime in a special database called repository.
2. This helps to see who has made what changes when and why. If any thing went wrong we can revert to previous revision easily using history.
3. Without version control sytem we have to maintain mulitple folders like (v1.0/v1.1/v1.2) for every change and collabrate manullay to merge with multiple member changes.  

There are 2 different categories in Version Control System
	1. Centralized System:
		The source code is centralized and teams work on codes by connecting to server.
		The draw back with this approach is if the server is down, teams will not able to track history until it becomes online and make difficult to development. 
		Example : SubVersioN
	2. Distributed System:
		The soruce code is distributed.
		This means local copies are created in local machine with history and the teams can work offline and easily synchornize directly with others.
		Example : Git, Mericural
	
Git Benifits:
	OpenSource
	SuperFast
	Scalable
	Cheap Branching/Merging
